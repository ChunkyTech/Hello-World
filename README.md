# Hello-World
New Repository

ChunkyTech here and I am interested in finally learning how to code.  I have been in the IT world for 20 years and I have not really mastered the art of coding or even scripting for that matter.  Its time to chage that.  My goal is to learn how to code and to enbark on a new career.
